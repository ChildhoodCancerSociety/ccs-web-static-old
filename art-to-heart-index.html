                        <p>We understand that children with cancer face many challenges, both physical and emotional. That's why we are excited to 
                            announce the "Art to Heart Campaign". This contest is designed to provide an outlet for children to express themselves 
                            creatively, find hope in their struggles, and connect with others who understand their journey.</p>
                        <p>Our aim is to create an uplifting and encouraging environment for children with cancer to showcase their artistic talents and 
                            inspire others. Through this contest, we hope to encourage children to find strength, courage, and hope in their lives, 
                            despite the challenges they face.</p>
                        <p>Winners of this contest will be able to bring their families on an all-expenses-paid VIP Disney/Universal/Seaworld Vacation 
                            with 5-star lodging for a week at Give Kids The World Village.</p>
